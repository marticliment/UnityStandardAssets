# Unity Standard Assets

**DISCLAIMER: The downloaded files are to be used at your own responsibility**

The lost Unity Standard Assets, in a `.unitypackage` importable file. They can be downloaded in three different ways:

&emsp;a) Clone the repository and combine the 4 `StandardAssets.unitypackage.00x` files.<br>
&emsp;b) Download the assembled `.unitypackage` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/marticliment/UnityStandardAssets/releases/tag/0.0.0).<br>
&emsp;c) Direct download link to the assembled file: https://github.com/marticliment/UnityStandardAssets/releases/download/0.0.0/StandardAssets.unitypackage

Once downloaded, they can be added to Unity following the usual importing process, via `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom package...`.

## Compatibility

Tested to work in:
 - Unity 2018 (latest release)

Not guaranteed to work on Unity 2019 and higher. However, some tweaks exist that can help it work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSOhkbO8xEA


Disclaimer: I installed the **Standard Assets** package from my Unity Assets library and I have repackaged into a `.unitypackage` so it to be importable via `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom package...`.
